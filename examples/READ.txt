studies:
in-depth analysis of many files/chunks of files in attempt to 
crack a certain section of the format.
dumps_and_disassemblies:
text representations of data from a specific file.
comes in various formats.
Unlike studies, format notes are used as instructions, whereas studies
form the foundations of the format notes.
Overall, these don't contribute a whole lot.
src.txt:
attributions... not working too well
anything else:
one of many example files, all in their original binary formats
