this is a manual dump + diassembly of the LctX found at offset 00 65 8d 66,
in a dir-opened copy of Spybotics : The Nightfall Incident.
Besides seemingly containing nothing of note, one value
does not match what the documentation says it can be.
Other parts of the documentation don't well explain what's going on
Conclusion: it's a bust.
Next Goals: 
attempt to crack the KEY* chunk, it must be important!
make automated tool to disassemble any chunk known to be associated with the compiled bytecode,
as it is far too tedious and inefficient to do this manually, and also highly prone to human error.
