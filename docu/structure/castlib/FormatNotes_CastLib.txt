		External cast files (CST,CCT,CXT) seem to not have these. It makes sense, because external casts only contain ONE

	Also, haven't had a chance to document this but I should add: the IDs in MCsL refer to the CAS* chunks, 
	based on their index in mmap. The CAS* are a table of the IDs of CASt chunks in the mmap table, iirc, 
	and the chunks those CASt rely on are found using KEY*. So it goes MCsL > CAS* > mmap > CASt >KEY* > Data 
	(such as BITD, snd , etc.) note that multiple chunks can be linked to one CASt in KEY*, for example the 
	sound headers can be seperate of the sound itself using sndH and sndS

	This is one of my more recent realizations and it is with this that I finally begin to understand the 
	structure somewhat.

	Also, note that LCsM isn't present in older Director movies as not all versions of Director have cast libraries.
