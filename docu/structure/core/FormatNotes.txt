		uint16 unknown // always zero
		uint32 memsize? // the number of bytes of additional memory beyond the chunk's length that will need to be allocated to parse the rest of the chunk, i.e. for the imap/mmap entries this value will be the number of bytes needed to be allocated in memory to store everything within the mmap table?

				IDs (ignoring free) is causing problems... and recent research with CAS* indicates certain values
				point to freespace (entries of solid 0x00, e.g. NULL) in the mapping table. Also noteworthy
				is the JavaScript parser at this time is unable to successfully parse the KEY* section in
				spybotics, and a majority of the CASt sections are somehow being skipped...
				This needs to be solved pronto, the castlib cannot be reconstructed without this data!

Section [ghost] junk
{
	// these are only seen in the mmap - when going to the offset specified, a different chunk name is found which this one replaces
	// effectively, "junk" replaces chunks that are currently empty, but may be needed later, such as, for example, an empty timeline in Director files
	// in the mmap, the fact the name is "junk" signifies that although they exist in the raw file, no memory is to be allocated for the chunk until it is needed
}

Section [ghost] free
{
	// these do not seem to actually exist, but are indexed in mmap for some reason
	// they typically have no offset (it's just zero)
	// they may serve the purpose of replacing deleted or obsolete chunks in the mmap (rather than empty chunks that simply don't need to be allocated yet, unlike junk, like the difference between empty/isset in PHP)

shockwave format types:
DXR : 'protected'
DCR : compressed (via zlib)
DIR : uncompressed + unprotected
CXT : 'protected'
CCT : compressed (via zlib)
CST : uncompressed + unprotected
W3D : 3D model/scene file (related to the open U3D format, but exact similarities/differences not yet discovered)
SWA : Audio file (variation of MP3, but contains some extra data for use by Shockwave)

purposes:
D*R : movie, runs stand-alone, may load C*T's as dependencies
C*T : 
{
	external "cast" , basically an external library of stuff. 
	D*R's are made of multiple internal casts, and will attempt to
	load external casts if any have been linked.
	Some movies can play without the external casts
	External casts are of a similar structure a movie,
	except they only contain one cast, and cannot run as a stand-alone application.
	There are subtle differences in their internal layout, more research is required to
	determine what all of these are.
}

extra notes:
Spybotics, does not actually require its external casts to run.
However, this might impact the music*

*All remaining copies/archives of Spybotics: The Nightfall Incident
do not have the sound_level_<1-5>.cct, and the snd_netload_<1-5>.cct files.
It's quite possible official releases never actually did use them.
the sound_level_<x> files are all empty, and the snd_netload_<x> files
contain alternative soundtracks. These tracks probably are for databattles.
