--==Director/Shockwave Lists==--
Director and Shockwave Player both use data structures known as lists to group sets of related data together.
There is a text-based representation used to serialize them, as well as for writing them out in Lingo source code.
For many years, no one ever took the time to create a converter for this format, or if they did, they never
released it.
There have been multiple attempts at cracking the DIR,DXR,DCR,CST,CXT,and CST formats, all with varying degrees 
of success, but it seems like no one has taken the time to write a tool for the list format. 
This file documents the specifics of the list format and even the basic process for converting them to JSON,
so others may try to implement these themselves. I also have written an open source tool for converting them to JSON.

Detailed explanation of them here:
http://www.deansdirectortutorials.com/Lingo/lists.htm

==Director/Shockwave format==
linear lists:
[
	"cat",
	"dog",
	"bird"
]

property lists:
[
	#type : "cat"
	#name : "Garfield",
	#color : "orange",
	etc...
]

symbol:
#theSymbol

==JSON format==
linear lists:
[
	"item",
	etc...
]

property lists:
{
	"property" : "value",
	etc...
}

symbol:
"#symbol"

==comparison/conversion==
#prop:"data" > "attr":"data"
[0,1,2] > [0,1,2]
#symbol > "#symbol" //well, this is the only one that can't technically be converted exactly... just don't use "#" as part of the data!
[#prop:"value"] > {"prop":"value"}

The actual details of properly converting these to JSON is somewhat more in-depth, but basically:
read the string. [   #prop:#value,  #prop2:#value2  ]
trim the extra white space from the string. [#prop:#value,#prop2:#value2] 
trim the outer brackets, or try. #prop:#value,#prop2:#value2
use the lengths of the string before and after bracket trimming to determine if it has children. if (len2 < len1)
If the string has been detected to represent a list... 
	create an array of 'children' strings. Array["#prop:#value","#prop2:#value2"]
	Check if the first child is a property...
		str.pos(0) == "#"
		str.pos(?) == ":"
	First item is definitely a property, so this is a property list. "#prop:#value"
	If the child is a property... 
		create an object. {}
		loop the children array...
			Get the property ID from the string...
				find the pos at which the first ":" is encountered and then...
					cut-off the "#" and return the part of the string from position 1 to and excluding the first ":"
					So, we will get these property ID's from the two children...
						"prop","prop2"
			Get the property values from the string...
				Same as with the id, we need to find the first ":"...
					But this time, again excluding that value, we want the portion of the string after it.
					Our two children yield these values...
						"#value","#value2"
			Now that we have the ID and the value, we assign a property/attribute to the object...
				obj[prop] = ...
					So, we need to determine what data type the value is, just as we did before...
						"#value" and "#value2" are both symbols.
						So, our object now looks like...
							this. {prop:"#value",prop2:"#value2"}
							And with this sample, we're done
	If the child is anything besides a property...
		create an array. []
		loop the children array...
			Just like with property values, the type of each child must be determined
			Arrays do not use named indeces, so we just push the new value to the array
If the string is determined not to represent a list...
	the simple data type must be determined from: symbol,number,string...
		First, symbol...
			str.pos(0) == "#"
			If it's a symbol...
				return the value as-is, that's the best conversion possible
		Alright, so it's not a symbol, let's try for number or string...
			Number...
				Should only contain numeric digits and not be enclosed in quotes...
					If so, return the result of casting it to a number
			String...
				Should be enclosed in quotes...
					If so, return the string without the outer quotes
					
A proper parser should handle errors, because it's been proven time and time again that the end user cannot be trusted
to use the program the right way, for various reasons. So, the parser should check for these, and make the user aware
something went wrong, and ideally, where, and why.
Some possible errors:
[[] = mix-matched/missing brackets
""" = bad string formatting
#prop[]: = that's an invalid property
#sym[b] = that's an invalid symbol
wt# = not even sure what that's supposed to be...
Not catching errors can, in really bad cases, result in freezes or crashes!

While this explicitly covers the coversion process for JSON, the process is similar, regardless of the format.

With all that said, good luck and have fun with these - Brain151

Properties are not case sensitive, from what i've painstakinly understood, after manually converted hundreds of lists to JS objects.

Referenced properties on values are also kinda confusing since you can put them in text format:
> [#partId: 86, #master: 47, #MorphsTo: 0, #description: "", #junkView: "", #UseView: "20b086v2", #UseView2: "", #offset: [0, 0], #Properties: [#Weight: 1, #Steering: 1], #Requires: [#a9], #Covers: [#a9], #new: 0]

Shouldn't it be possible to just use a JSON parser as a base (kinda described above) and modify it to use # signs? I'm trying so hard to understand parsers but wow, they're advanced. - MrBrax
