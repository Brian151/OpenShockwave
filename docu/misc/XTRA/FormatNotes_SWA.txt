SHOCKWAVE AUDIO (SWA) FORMAT:
For the most part, SWA files sre just regular MP3 files.
Most programs and libraries capable of playing MP3 *technically* support them.
However, they typically contain extra data for playback-related things.
Audacity seems to have problems when playing/editing SWA. -Brian151
