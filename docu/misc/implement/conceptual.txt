May or may not get worked on at a later day:

Director Open Format { 
	possibly .cot, .dor
	RIFX based, but more consistent and possibly with less weird lookup stuff to do
}
Director JavaScript?/JSON?/Web? Format {
	zip file, similar to Flash XFL, but
	using JSON instead of XML
	designed to be loaded by JS or Web Assembly
	modules yet to be created (if ever). 
	Also serves as a more human-friendly version
	of the format that practically anyone could edit.	
}
