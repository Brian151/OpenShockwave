extended PAL file, well...sorta, some changes have been made
to accomodate our specific needs, but no alterations have been
made that should cause conflicts with programs that read/write PAL files,
unless said programs already are doing something they're not supposed to

chosen usage:
losslessly import/export CLUT section (palette data) to/from Director files

Section RIFF {
	Uint32 [lit] fileLen
	FourCC formType ("PAL ") //this is a RIFF PAL file, part of the 'standard' RIFF format group
	Section data
	{
		Uint32 [lit] datLen
		Uint16 [lit] datVer 0x0300
		Uint16 [lit] colCount
		RGB24Array (colCount) entries 
		{
			Byte red
			Byte green
			Byte blue
			// only keeping this to preserve consistency and keep the file 'valid' with other programs 
			// that support RIFF PAL format!
			Byte flags
		}
	}
	Section dat2
	{
		// this section added to store the extra information from the CLUT section,
		// just in case it's actually needed for something
		Uint32 [lit] dat2Len
		RGB24Array(data.colCount) entries
		{
			Byte redExtra 
			Byte greenExtra 
			Byte blueExtra 
		}
	}
}
