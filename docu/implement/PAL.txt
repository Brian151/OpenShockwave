extended PAL file, well...sorta, some changes have been made
to accomodate our specific needs, but no alterations have been
made that should cause conflicts with programs that read/write PAL files,
unless said programs already are doing something they're not supposed to

chosen usage:
losslessly import/export CLUT section (palette data) to/from Director files

"RIFF" file sig
uint32 [lit] fileLen
	"PAL " form sig //this is a RIFF PAL file, part of the 'standard' RIFF format group
	{
	"data" data sig
	Uint32 [lit] datLen
	Uint16 [lit] datVer 0x0300
	Uint16 [lit] colCount
	<colCount> entries 
		{
		byte red
		byte green
		byte blue
		// only keeping this to preserve consistency and keep the file 'valid' with other programs 
		// that support RIFF PAL format!
		byte flags
		}
	}
	{
	// this section added to store the extra information from the CLUT section,
	// just in case it's actually needed for something
	"dat2" secondary data sig
	Uint32 [lit] dat2Len
	<data.colCount> entries
		{
			byte redExtra 
			byte greenExtra 
			byte blueExtra 
		}
	}
