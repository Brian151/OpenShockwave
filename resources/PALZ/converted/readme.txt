mac palette intitaially exported by MrBrax, and converted to
extended RIFF PAL by brian151

palstub.bin is a template to make new pal files real fast, all it needs
is the correct length values, and the color data

sysPals.json contains their original names, since they're not
exactly "safe" for use as file names.

A similar format will likely be used when exporting palettes from
movies and external casts

errors:
PAL header might be wrong... simple enough fix if it is
HTML5 tool for some reason slightly altered some values, effects neglible
