previous screenshot now split, and cropped in such a way an automated tool
can read the palletes from the image.

a tool for exporting the palettes as hex is added, programmed in 
JavaScript/HTML5,utliizing CanvasContext2D's getImageData() function. 
It does appear to sometimes slightly alter values, cause uknown. 
Seems pretty unnoticable, though.
